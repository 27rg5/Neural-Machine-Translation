# Neural Machine Translation

This is a repository for my project, wherein I converted **Hebrew to English** using Deep Learning.

The dataset used for the project is the one present on this website - [http://www.manythings.org/anki/](http://www.manythings.org/anki/). It has also been uploaded to this repository. 
The model I created for this task was a **LSTM based sequence-to-sequence model in TensorFlow 2**. 
I used the free Google Colab GPU for the project (*GPU is highly recommended for this task*).
