This is a repository for my project, wherein I **converted Hebrew to English using Deep Learning**.

The dataset used for the project is the one present on this website - [http://www.manythings.org/anki/](http://www.manythings.org/anki/). It has also been uploaded to this repository. 

The model I created for this task was a **LSTM based sequence-to-sequence model in TensorFlow**. The trained model and the prediction file have been uploaded to this repository. 

The free Google Colab GPU was used for the project (*GPU is highly recommended for this task*).
